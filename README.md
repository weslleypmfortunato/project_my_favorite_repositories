<h1 align="center">🌞 Weather Forecast App Rev.2 (with TailwindCSS) 🌤</h1>

<h2>💻 Overview </h2>

<p>This is the latest version of the Weather Current Forecast built using ReactJS, Axios, HTML, TailwindCSS and Open Weather API.

I built this Rev.2 to put into practice my learningship in TailwindCSS. This is my first project using it, and as I did not use a CSS file, I could reduce the code from almost 360 lines to 122 lines.
The app allows users to easily view current weather forecasts for any city around the world 🌎, using data provided by the Open Weather API and it is totally responsive. You can try it on your 📱 smartphone or desktop.

In addition to its functionality, the project boasts an elegant and user-friendly design, making for a pleasant and intuitive user experience. The interface includes features such as a city search field, elegant weather icons and essential information to keep you aware and avoid surprises throughout your day.

The Current Weather Forecast is a great option for anyone seeking accurate and reliable real-time weather information. </p>

<h2> 👨 About the developer</h2>

<p>I am a passionate animal lover with a keen interest in Canadian weather. After spending 13 years working for Foxconn manufacturing Apple products, where I gained valuable experience in project management and quality reliability testing in the electronics sector, I decided to take on a new challenge by moving to Canada and starting a new career in web development.

I am currently pursuing my dream of becoming a proficient web developer by attending college and learning everything from scratch. Being in Victoria, BC, allows me to explore my love for nature by hiking and discovering new places in my spare time.

I am a firm believer in continuous improvement and pay close attention to every detail, no matter how small, to ensure the final product is of the highest quality. I am excited to see where my newfound skills and experiences will take me, and I am eager to make the most of every opportunity that comes my way..</p>
